Every techy you talk to will have their own list of "must-haves" and "best" tools to use, this is mine. You can replace half of these with something does the job just as well, or maybe better. I am interested to change out parts at any time but for right now, these work for me.

## EDC
### Command Line
I consider the command line critical for any good admin, and even helpdesk. It is more efficient, more powerful and sometimes the only option for certain products or tasks. Even Office365 and Azure lean heavily on PowerShell for many fundamental tasks.

* PowerShell
    * While mainly a Windows focused shell, I do use this on Linux as well just to keep my profile the same across all platforms (why use or force two shells to act the same).
* [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)
    * A big helper is a nice prompt in your shell, check out my [PowerShell profile](https://git.dev0.sh/piper/powershell_profile/src/branch/master/personal_profile.ps1) to see my various aliases and random bits.
* [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)
* gnupg

### GUI
* [Tabby](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby)
* [MRemoteNG](https://mremoteng.org/)
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
* [Espanso](https://espanso.org/)
* [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/) (notepad++ or any other real text editor works here, evolve beyond Notepad.exe)

### Hardware
