Every techy you talk to will have their own list of "must-haves" and "best" tools to use, this is mine. You can replace half of these with something does the job just as well, or maybe better. I am willing to change out parts at any time but for right now, these work for me.

## EDC
### Command Line
I consider the command line critical for any good admin, and even helpdesk. It is more efficient, more powerful and sometimes the only option for certain products or tasks. Even Office365 and Azure lean heavily on PowerShell for many fundamental tasks.

##### PowerShell
While mainly a Windows focused shell, I do use this on Linux as well just to keep my profile the same across all platforms (why use or force two shells to act the same). If you work on Windows or anything in the Microsoft Cloud you must know at least some basic PowerShell.

##### [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)
Anyone who has spent time in the Linux realm knows the power of a package manager. Scoop is a Windows package manager. It may not be the first, or the most popular but it is quick and runs as a user without admin just fine dropping all its files in a single directory making use simple and clean. 

I install my entire environment using this tool and a [messy script](https://git.dev0.sh/piper/scoop_install/src/branch/master/scoop_install.ps1). 

##### git


##### gnupg


##### [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)
A big helper is a nice prompt in your shell, check out my [PowerShell profile](https://git.dev0.sh/piper/powershell_profile/src/branch/master/personal_profile.ps1) to see my various aliases and random bits.
