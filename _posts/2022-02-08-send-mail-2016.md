I was having issues with emails for my various [backup scripts](/tags/#backups) not sending emails with my [submodule]({% post_url 2022-01-04-email-script%}), I was seeing hit or miss results but I mostly disregarded them intending to resolve the issue down the road. This issue came to a head when I noticed my Smart Card expiration notices at work had stopped sending, but all my password expiration notices were working fine.

## Logs
Checking the logs I saw `Send-MailMessage : Unable to read data from the transport connection: net_io_connectionclosed.` each time an email tried to send with `Send-MailMessage`. I was able to run the same command from my workstation just fine though.

## Fix
My password expiration notices are sent from a Windows 10 machine, while my machines that have email issues are all running Server 2016. Once I started searching this up (and once I added a trusty `site:reddit.com`) I came across [a fix](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/p6kqok/office_365_relay_issue_from_windows_2016/). 

Once I added `[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12` into my scripts this issue was resolved.
