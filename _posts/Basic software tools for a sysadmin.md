Command Line
I consider the command line critical for any good admin, and even helpdesk. It is more efficient, more powerful and sometimes the only option for certain products or tasks. Even Office365 and Azure lean heavily on PowerShell for many fundamental tasks.

* PowerShell
    * While mainly a Windows focused shell, I do use this on Linux as well just to keep my profile the same across all platforms (why use or force two shells to act the same).
* [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)
    * A big helper is a nice prompt in your shell, check out my [PowerShell profile](https://git.dev0.sh/piper/powershell_profile/src/branch/master/personal_profile.ps1) to see my various aliases and random bits.
