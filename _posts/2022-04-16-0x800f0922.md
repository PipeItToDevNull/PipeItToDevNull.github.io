I updated my XCP-NG host back in January, after those updates none of my Windows Server VMs would boot back up with the error `FAILED_TO_START_EMULATOR`. I dug into [some articles](https://xcp-ng.org/forum/topic/4858/guest-uefi-secure-boot-on-xcp-ng/23?lang=en-GB&page=2) that eventually got me to some talk about [UEFI Secure boot certs](https://xcp-ng.org/docs/guides.html#guest-uefi-secure-boot). At the time I was in a rush and decided to try disabling Secure Boot rather than applying any fixes. That worked, and I moved on.

A couple months down the road (last week) I noticed my servers were not applying their updates properly, they were "could not complete update, undoing changes" for every patch. The error was always `0x800f0922`. I dug around a bit, did some random fixes but once I checked the [CBS Logs](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/what-is-cbs-log-file) I noticed error messages dealing with Secure Boot. 

I went back to the posts above and actually tried applying a fix. It ended up being one simple command that was ran on the XCP-NG host to resolve everything, `secureboot-certs install`. 

> üìù You can check the state of your certs with the command `secureboot-certs report`. 

Once these certs were in place I was able to shut down my VMs, toggle secure boot back on and after they came back online all the updates took successfully.

> ‚ùó LESSON: Windows Server may not update if you turn off Secure Boot after initial installation with it on.
