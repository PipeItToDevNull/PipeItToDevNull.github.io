I want to migrate to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 for my homelab, I am currently on CentOS 7 and due to the CentOS 8/Stream shennanigans I believe that just migrating to full RHEL is the better decision. Luckily Red Hat offers free RHEL licensing to developers but setup and activation can be tricky, it has screwed me over in the past.

## Setup
1. To get started you need to have a developers account, this can be created in the [Red Hat Developer program portal](https://developers.redhat.com/register).
2. Once registered you can verify that you have the Developer subscription on the [Subscriptions](Hunter@Kimbrough.io) page.
3. Red Hat Enterprise Linux [Download](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download)
