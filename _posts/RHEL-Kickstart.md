# RHEL-Kickstart
RedHat and its derivatives can utilize special configuration files called "Kickstart files" to make installation automated and repeatable. I wanted to explore this for my [RHEL Migration]() project where I am moving from CentOS 7 to RHEL 8.

## Obtaining a basic configuration
The simplest way to get a basic Kickstart file is to install your distro like you normally would then copy the `anaconda-ks.cfg` file that is generated by the installer (called Anaconda) and left in `/root` on your new system. This file contains the parameters that you chose during your graphical setup process. It holds all settings including:

* Package selection
* Keyboard layout and language selection
* Network configurations
  * Hostname
  * Static/DHCP settings
* Disk layouts
* Timezone
* Root password and optional user configurations
* Password policies

## Using your Kickstart file for an unattended install

## Changes you can make to the Kickstart file
### Package management
In the `%packages` block you will see any packages you have already chosen to install. For me this is "@^minimal-environment". In this case "@^" marks a meta-group of packages. 

You can add more packages below `%packages` header, for me these are:

```
%packages
@^minimal-environment
# realm packages
realmd
sssd
oddjob
oddjob-mkhomedir
adcli
samba-common-tools
# other packages
vim
iptables-services
```

You can also remove packages from the selection. I do not like Firewalld but this is added in the "@^minimal-environment" meta-package. To remove a package use a `-`. My entire package selection is as follows:

```
%packages
@^minimal-environment
# realm packages
realmd
sssd
oddjob
oddjob-mkhomedir
adcli
samba-common-tools
# other packages
vim
iptables-services
cockpit
# exlcude
-firewalld
%end
```
