I am a Systems Administrator and IT Manager with over 5 years of experience working in DoD environments. I currently lead a team supporting 300 users in a mixed environment consisting of Windows and Linux infrastructure, primarily virtualized using XenServer. My responsibilities include maintaining compliance and implementation as it relates to NIST 800-171 and CMMC(v2). Automation and systems maintenance tasks are handled using a combination of PowerShell and Ansible, as well as hands on break/fix of critical systems.

At home and during my free-time I assist in tech communities offering help to users as well as maintaining various SaaS and Cloud Infrastructure components they may utilize.  I stay up-to-date on the latest trends and test out new ideas in [my homelab](/homelab) which is made up of a healthy mix of current technologies.

### Purpose
This blog is to serve as a pseudo-wiki replacement for any notes I think are useful enough to share and a place to post some of the things I already share with people and need to constantly re-write each time I want to explain. I am not a writer, I am not a developer, I guarantee neither the English nor the code to be pretty but it all hopefully works.
