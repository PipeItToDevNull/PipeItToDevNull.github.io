### Who am I
I am a Senior Systems Administrator and IT Manager with over 5 years of experience working in DoD environments. I currently lead a team supporting 300 users in a mixed environment consisting of Windows and Linux infrastructure, primarily virtualized using XenServer. My responsibilities include maintaining compliance and implementation as it relates to NIST 800-171 and CMMC(v2). Automation and systems maintenance tasks are handled using a combination of PowerShell and Ansible, as well as hands on break/fix of critical systems.

At home and during my free-time I assist in tech communities offering help to users as well as maintaining various SaaS and Cloud Infrastructure components they may utilize.  I keep up to date and test out new products [my homelab](/homelab) that consists of AD, docker, whatever other random project I am interested in at the time.

### Purpose
This is a place for me to catalog and share little successes or stupid things I figure out through the course of my days.
