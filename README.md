### Who am I
I do system administration for a small business handling all of the day to day tasks from Windows 10 issues to Office365/Azure and then round it out with CentOS and Debian servers for a bulk of our services.

At home and during my free-time I assist in techsupport communities and run [my homelab](/homelab) that consists of AD, docker, whatever other random project I am interested in at the time.

### Purpose
This is a place for me to catalog and share little successes or stupid things I figure out through the course of my days.
